# Brain Tumor VGG16 Transfer Learning
Deep learning brain tumor classification using fine-tuned VGG16 with transfer learning. Achieves 89% accuracy in classifying MRI scans into 4 categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor.

## About the Project
This system analyzes MRI brain scans to classify them into four categories:
- **Glioma**: A type of brain tumor that occurs in the brain and spinal cord
- **Meningioma**: Tumor that arises from the meninges surrounding the brain
- **Pituitary**: Tumor in the pituitary gland
- **No Tumor**: Normal brain scan without tumor

The model uses transfer learning with a pre-trained VGG16 architecture, fine-tuned on brain MRI data to achieve medical-grade classification accuracy.
